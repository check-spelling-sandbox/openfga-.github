# OpenFGA Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As contributors and maintainers in the Okta and Auth0 community, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

We have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all of our open source community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the open source community in public spaces. 

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to us at community@openfga.dev. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

We pledge to maintain the confidentiality of the reporter of any incident and only share when we determine it is necessary to protect the Okta Service, individuals, or for safety, legal compliance, or other such legitimate reasons. Should we need to, Okta will process any personal data you share in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.okta.com/privacy-policy/).
